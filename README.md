Keep moving forward.

Randonneur is a library to make changes to life cycle inventory databases. You can use it to re-link your data to the latest version of a background database, to update existing databases with new data, or to perform other data transformations. Randonneur uses JSON files to describe these changes; contrast this with [wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst), which can do these manipulations and more, but documents its manipulations in code.

Although designed to work with [Brightway](https://brightway.dev/), this library is not Brightway-specific.

## Usage

### Generic usage pattern

* Load a `randonneur` data migration file, normally from [randonneur_data](https://github.com/brightway-lca/randonneur_data) using `randonneur_data.Registry().get_file()`
* Load an inventory database, normally in the [common Brightway inventory format](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_interface_schemas)
* Apply the data transformation using either `migrate_edges` or `migrate_nodes`, optionally specifying the fields used for matching the transformation data, any mappings necessary to make the transformation data schema fit into your data schema, what filters should be applied to the input data (if any), and which verbs (`create`, `replace`, `update`, `delete`, or `disaggregate`) you want to apply
* Save the modified data

### Data format

Migration data is specified in a JSON file as a single dictionary. This file **must** include the following keys:

* `name`: Follows the [data package specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#name).
* `licenses`: Follows the [data package specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#licenses). Must be a list.
* `version`: Follows the [data package specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#version). Must be a string.
* `contributors`: Follows the [data package specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#contributors). Must be a list.
* `mapping`: A dictionary mapping the labels used in the transformation
* `graph_context`: A list with either the string 'nodes', 'edges', or both. The context in which these transformations should be used.

In addition, the following properties should follow the [data package specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) if provided:

* `description`
* `sources`
* `homepage`
* `created`

You can specify the following optional attributes:

* `source_id`: An identifier for the source dataset following the [common identifier standard](#common-database-release-identifier-standard). Useful if the source data is specific.
* `target_id`: An identifier for the target dataset following the [common identifier standard](#common-database-release-identifier-standard). Useful if the target data is specific.

Finally, at least one change type should be included. The change types are:

* `create`
* `replace`
* `update`
* `delete`
* `disaggregate`

You can use `randonneur.Datapackage` to ensure correct formatting and serialization.

See the [randonneur_data](https://github.com/brightway-lca/randonneur_data) repo for more real-world implementations.

### Common database release identifier standard

At Brightcon 2022 we developed the following simple format for common database release identifiers:

`<database name>-<version>-<optional modifier>`

Here are some examples:

* `agribalyse-3.1.1`
* `forwast-1`
* `ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff`
* `SimaPro-9-biosphere`

## Theory

In normal life cycle assessment practice, we work with a large variety of software and database applications, and often need to harmonize data across these heterogeneous systems. Because many of these systems do not use simple unique identifiers, we often need to link across systems based on attibutes. For example, if the name, location, and unit of an input are the same in system `A` and `B`, then we can infer that these refer to the same underlying concept.

In the real world nothing is so simple. Each player in the LCA data world is trying to give their users a positive experience, but over time this has led to many different terms for the same concept. Some legacy systems restrictions also prevent complete imports, and cause data transformations that are difficult to reverse engineer.

This library defines both a specification for transformation data files which allow different systems to be linked together by harmonizing the matching attributes, and a software-agnostic implementation of functions needed to use that format.

## Foot-guns



## Transformations

### Replace

Replacement substitutes an exchange one-to-one; as such, the new exchange must be completely defined. **However**, the `amount` should not be specified; rather, an `allocation` factor should be given, and the `amount` of the original exchange will be multiplied by `allocation`.

If `allocation` is not given, a default value of 1.0 is used.

Aside from the quantitative values, no other data from the original exchange is taken over to the new exchange. If you only want to change a few fields, use an `update` instead. If you don't want the exchange amount re-scaled, use a combination of `delete` and `create`.

The data format for `replace` type is:

```python
{
    "replace": [{
        "source": {
            # All fields needed to identify the exchange to be replaced
        },
        "target": {
            # All fields needed to define the new exchange
        },
        # `dataset` is optional
        "dataset": {
            # All fields needed to identify the dataset to change
        }
    }]
}
```

### Update

`update` changes attributes the same way that `replace` does - the only difference is that `replace` shows the intent to refer to a new object instead of an existing object with different attributes. Given the messiness of real-world data, there is no real bright line between these concepts, and their code implementation is identical.

#### Create

Creates a new edge or node.

Because we are specifying a new exchange, we need to list **all** information needed to define an exchange, **including** the exchange `amount`. This is different than the other modification types, where *relative* amounts are given with the key `allocation`. We can't give relative amounts here because we have no exchange to refer to, and we don't have a surefire way to identify the reference production exchange (and there might not be one in any case).

If you want to add an exchange to all datasets:

```python
{
    "create": [{
        "targets": [{
            # All fields needed to define an exchange
        }]
    }]
}
```

If you only want to create an exchange in one dataset:

```python
{
    "create": [{
        "targets": [{
            # All fields needed to define an exchange
        }],
        "dataset": {
            # All fields needed to identify the dataset
        }
    }]
}
```

`dataset` must be a `dict`, not a list; it can only identify one dataset.

Note that in the `wurst` format, `dataset` use the key `reference product` while exchanges use the key `product`; these are two different concepts, so have different keys.

### Delete

Delete exchanges. Follows the same patterns as `replace` and `update`:

```python
{
    "delete": [{
        "source": {
            # All fields needed to identify the exchange to be deleted
        },
        # `dataset` is optional
        "dataset": {
            # All fields needed to identify the dataset to change
        }
    }]
}
```

### Disaggregate

Disaggregation is splitting one exchange into many. The `allocation` field is used to determine how much of the exchange passes to each new exchange.

The new exchanges start as **copies** of the original exchange, and are updating using the additional data provided. In other words, this functions more like an `update` than a `replace`. This is because the most common use case for disaggregation is to split one input or output among several regions, where almost all metadata for the child exchanges would be identical.

`allocation` fields do not have to sum to one.

The data format includes a list of new exchanges for each matched source:

```python
{
    "disaggregate": [{
        "source": {
            # All fields needed to identify the exchange to be disaggregated
        },
        "targets": [{
            # Some fields which you want to change
        }],
        # `dataset` is optional
        "dataset": {
            # All fields needed to identify the dataset to change
        }
    }]
}
```
