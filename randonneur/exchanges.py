    """Migrate the exchanges in the datasets given in ``lci_database`` using the data in
    ``migration_data``.

    The types of changes applied are controlled by the input flags ``create``, ``disaggregate``,
    ``replace``, ``update``, and ``delete``. See the README for more detail on these changes.

    You can filter the datasets to be changed, and the exchanges to consider, with the filters
    ``dataset_filter`` and ``exchange_filter``. This filters control _if_ a dataset or exchange
    should be modified (i.e. it is modified if the function returns ``True``). If given, they
    should be a callable, and take the complete activity dataset or a single exchange dataset as an
    input.

    You can specify the fields used to test for equality between exchange and exchange, or dataset
    and dataset. Be careful, if you specify a field missing in both the ``migration_data`` and the
    ``lci_database``, the equality condition will match.

    Returns ``lci_database`` with altered content.
